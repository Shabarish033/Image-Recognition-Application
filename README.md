# Image-Recognition-Application
In this project I have developed an application that uses a Convolution Neural Network to identify images. 

To use the application follow the instructions as given below:
# Code details:
DataPreprocessor.py = Contains instructions for DataPreprocessing, creation of Test Set and Training Set.
                      This is the file you run on Python IDE.
CNN.py = Contains the CNN model that is used for image recognition.
UI.rar = Contains image files used by the user interface

# Instructions to run the code
  1 - In a folder place the codes DataPreprocessor.py and CNN.py
  2 - Extract the UI.rar in the same folder described above.
  3 - Run the DataPreprocessor.py file in a python IDE, make sure you have the following libraries installed.
      1 - Pandas
      2 - scikit-learn
      3 - Keras
      4 - TensorFlow
      5 - Tkinter
  4 - Upon running the DataPreprocessor.py a window pops, provide the path to a editable working directory, and path to image
      files.
  5 - During the machine learning phase make sure that the images are grouped and placed in the correct folders.
  6 - Once data is Preprocessed, the next window provides the User the option to train the model.
  7 - Once the model is trained (learnt) you can test the model by providing path to images that can be used to test the model.
